# Web_Programming
A repository to build web components and files.
---

These components I am working on are a collection of files to show as a customized web page resume.
I am doing this on my free time and will be continually building onto them. 

Files built and to be added.
- [WebSite about me](index.html)
- [Cssfile](customcss.css)
- [JavaScript file](customjs.js)

This website is meant to be built on top of index.html that takes a few inputs and submits them through a series of PHP scripts.
It will build a database of Favorite songs with song name, composer, and artist values
- [What is your Favorite songs](webClassHTMLFile1.html)
- [Post to database](dataCollectionFromHTML1.php)
- [Total Results of Favorite Songs](surveyResults.php)
